The day before the\nconference, there was a traditional dinner for speakers. I like this tradition as it makes possible for us speakers to\nmeet our fellows and the conference organizers so that the next days we work as a team to provide the very best event. As\nusual, we were asking each other what the talks are about. When it was my turn, I started to explain that my talk is\ngoing to be about building infrastructure for a design system and particularly a design system website. One person\ninterrupted me with a question \"A style guide?\". And that is the key issue. Many people think that **design systems**\nare\nequal to **style guides**. But they are much more, they must be much more. On this page, I show what is a design system from\ndifferent perspectives: design, development, project and even business.\n\n</i>\n\n![](./figure11.png)\n\n## What is a design system for me?\n\nWe can have a look at who are the actual or potential users of design systems, and what are their professional needs in\nthis context.\n\n\nDesign systems are often understood as libraries of components. In this regard, the developers are seeing the system\nmostly from this perspective. Developers would like to have documentation for every component, examples of usage and\nmaybe explanation of the implementation details. Apart from that, they would need information related to the whole\nsystem. Such as release notes, instructions for linking the library to the project, etc. For contribution, they need to\nknow what is the library code style and contribution policy. To give feedback, they need the contact information of the design system team and/or access to relevant boards or chats.\n\n\n\nDesigners also need documentation for every pattern, especially the reasons behind them. Other design-related\ndocumentation such as color palette, spacing examples, tone of voice, and many more helps them to create new patterns\nwhich are coherent with the rest of the system. They also need information about how to collaborate with other fellow\ndesigners and what are the tools to use. Designers are interested in seeing their creations alive, thus they\nneed to know how the process goes further on the development and later stages.\n\n\n\nProject managers or owners need to have a basic representation of the design system since this is what is used to build the\ninterface for their product. They are also interested in release notes as in something that has been implemented. Apart from that, managers need to know the design system's nearest future or, in particular, what new components are going to be\nreleased and what are the upcoming changes to the existing ones. For that, managers need to see the design system's\nroadmap and learn its strategy as well as be able to discuss this with the relevant people.\n\n\n\nOn the business levels of the company, especially if speaking about mid-size or large companies, design systems are seen\nas internal products and tools. People of this specialization need to have a larger scale picture of the system.\nAlso, they must be especially interested into design system's meta information such as what is its impact, how it helps\nin-team and cross-team collaboration and maybe even the numbers of how much the company earns and saves thanks to the\ndesign system.\n\n\n## Design system — what is behind?\n\nDesign systems are yet evolving concept, our understanding of them is changing. But for sure a design system must serve the\nneeds of all the people involved in product creation and managing the company. This brings us to the conclusion that **a design\nsystem is not equal to a library of components or to a style guide, it is something bigger**. From my experience, a\nfunctioning and living design system means the following.\n\n#### Shared practices\n\n\nDesign system provides and documents shared practices, based on which you design your product or a bunch of products under\nthe same brand. A library of components and style guide as their documentation are such shared practices. However,\nshared practices are not limited to them but also include more abstract or more design related things such as visual\nlanguage or tone of voice. Or on the contrary, they can be deeply technical and reflect your approach to code (aka code\nstyle).\n\n\n#### Tools\n\n\nThis brings us to the tools which our company could have for all the developers and designers to share. This means\nprofessional software to use and its plugins, scripts for processing and optimizing visuals and code, development and\ndesign environment, etc.\n\n\n#### Processes\n\nAt the next level, design systems would mean the processes which are followed in the company to achieve the outlined\ngoals. Often spoken that design systems bridge the gap between specializations. This means that the design system should\nestablish the processes in teams or even on the company level.\n\n\n#### Community\n\nThe processes bring us to those for whom they are created, or to the people. As mentioned above, design systems ensure multidisciplinary collaboration and are meant to help the working collective as a whole. In this regard, having a design\nsystem implies constant work with our fellow developers, designers and project owners as with a community.\n\n\n## Way to go\n\nA comprehensive design system would have all the aspects listed above; not only a style guide or a library but\ndocumentation and helpful tools for all the practices to follow, outlined and tuned processes for achieving the goals and\nhelping the routines as well as own community-related documentations, instruments, and actions.\n\nCreating and maintaining the design system is not limited to making visual designs and coding but does include service\ndesign, project and community management. Moreover, a design system tightly connected to brand and business of the company, so the\nmethods of running it have to be tailored for the specific organization and its teams. These are the topics for\nmany more articles and discussions (yet published [Maintaining design systems with proper user\nresearch](https://medium.com/elisa-design/maintaining-design-systems-with-user-research-3ba5feafc336) and presented\n[Building design systems that leverage your designers, developers, and\nproducts](http://varya.me/design-systems-thinking/)).\n\n<i>\n\nComing back to the story in very beginning, my talk was about documenting all the listed aspects at a company design\nsystem website and organizing the processes for its constant evolving: [slides](https://varya.me/react-finland-2019/),\n[video](https://youtu.be/gDkUpx0dVc0?t=9993).\n\n</i>\n\n![](./ds-infrastructure.png)\n\n\n#### Source\nThis article was originally published at [varya.me](https://varya.me/design-systems/what-is-a-design-system/).","title":"What is a design system?","description":"And why it is more than just a library or a style guide","layout":"LayoutBlog","seo":{"desc":"The concept of design systems is much wider than how it is often understood.

However, usually,\nthere is a difference. A design system bridges the gap between disciplines and between the teams across the organization, so\nit requires involvement of all those stakeholders and their mutual contribution. To make this the most successful, a\nDesign System needs transparent processes and tools communicating these processes to all the people involved.\n\nAccording to a research I made in several organizations,\nthe lack of information is the most painful point for\nthe usual Design System users. Even well-documented Design Systems face this problem. Often a potential design-system\ncontributor does not have a focus on Design Systems as a concept and experience in maintaining the\nlibraries. At the same time, these representatives of the projects using Design Systems are the most important people to\nbe involved. Developing the actual projects, they have the most knowledge about the business needs of the company\napplications and are much more connected to the users than abstract design-system developers. Making these people\nsmoothly contribute to the Design System ensures its coverage, actuality, and instant expanding as well as saves the\nresources. This can be achieved with a very detailed guidance not only for the technical or design aspects of the Design\nSystem but also for its processes.\n\nTo start contribution, it is crucial to have a clear vision what to do in specific situations and have a support for\nmaking decisions. This aspect is being actively discussed in the community and some offer their solutions, for example,\nBrad Frost presents a decision tree:\n\n![](./pattern-addition-flowchart.png)<br/>\nSource: \"Maintaining Design Systems\" http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-5/\n\nBelow, I show an altered version in a form of an interactive component. This is a visual illustration of what happens to a\npattern on its way from identifying the need to actual implementation and how different the path might be depending on the\nsituation.\nThis process is called **Pattern Journey**.\n\n## Pattern Journey - Interactive Scheme\n\n![](./pattern-journey.png)\n\nThe scheme shows possible paths from identifying the need in a pattern to implementing it. Answers to the displayed questions help to\nchoose the right way. Note that **you can click on the questions** to get additional guidance on how to get the answer.\nFor a specific project, the instructions can be more detailed and contain links to communication channels, pages of\ndocumentation, repositories, Abstract spaces or Dropbox.\n\nIn the video, you can see how it works.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kKnTN3EswnU\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n## Examples of paths through Pattern Journey\n\nThe patterns make different journeys if it is a completely new UI element, changing or expending the existing one or\nmigrating from a project to the library. Let me show you some (but not all situations). In each of them, a potential\ncontributor starts from the top of the scheme and goes further navigated with the questions and answers to them. The\nadditional text is what they see in the popup when they are wondering how they should find an answer to the questions.\n\n### Implementing a new component\n\n![](./pattern-journey__pattern-library--implement-new.png)\n\nTakes steps are:\n\n#### 1. Is the pattern in the library?\n\nYou can search for patterns at the <i>Design System / Pattern Libarary website</i>.\nFigure out what could be a name or a keyword for the pattern you are looking for, and use if in the website search.\n\nIf you don't find anything suitable, you can also ask other people in the\n<i>instant communication channels</i> like Slack / Flowdock / Mattermost etc.\n\nAnswer: _No. There is no pattern in the library._\n\n#### 2. Anything similar at other projects?\n\nAsk around if people at other projects implement anything similar. You can instantly ask in the\ninstant communication channels (Slack, Flowdock, etc)\nor raise this quesion in regular Design or Develoment meetings. Also, you can ask people directly.\n\nAnswer: _No. I could not find anything similar._\n\n#### 3. Can it be used by other projects in the future?\n\nIs there future need for such component at other projects? Discuss this with the other teams, and\ndo this publically in the\ncommunication channels (Slack, Flowdock, etc).\nYou can also ask people directly or raise this question at regular cross-company Design or Development meetings.\n\nAnswer: _Yes. There are at least two more teams interested in the pattern._\n\n#### 4. Implement the pattern\n\nIt seems that you need to add this pattern into the\nDesign System / Pattern Library.\nTo start with process, usually you need to create a ticket in the task tracker system\n(JIRA, Trello, etc) and/or communicate about what you are going to do directly to the people.\nFollow the workflow for implementing new patterns which usually includes task flow, communication standards and code style.\n\n_Wait for release_\n\n#### 5. Use it\n\nYour desired pattern is already a part of the Design System / Pattern Library. Check the\n<i>Design System / Pattern Library website</i>\nfor its documentation.\nUse the component as it is documented. If you have question, do not hesitate to ask in the\ninstant communication channels (Slack, Flowdock, etc).\nThe suggestions and pull requests for the documentation improvement are very welcome.\n\n### Taking the pattern from another project\n\n![](./pattern-journey__pattern-library--from-other-project.png)\n\n#### 1. Is the pattern in the library?\n\nAnswer: _No. There is no pattern in the library._\n\n#### 2. Anything similar at other projects?\n\nAnswer: _Yes. The is similar pattern at other project._\n\n#### 3. Can you take it as it is?\n\nCan you borrow the code of this component and use it without any change? So that both you and the \"donor\" project would\nbe using the same code?\n\nAnswer: _No. It is similar to what I need but I have to alter it._\n\n#### 4. Do other teams ready to use new altered version?\n\nIf you change the existing component so that it meets your requirements,\nare the current users of it able to use the altered version?\nAsk them directly or raise this question publically. As usual,\nyou can communicate in the\ncommunication channels (Slack, Flowdock, etc).\n\nAnswer: _Yes. They are happy with my changes._\n\n#### 5. Implement the pattern\n\n_Wait for release_\n\n#### 6. Use it\n\n### Fix existing pattern\n\n![](./pattern-journey__pattern-library--fix-pattern.png)\n\n#### 1. Is the pattern in the library?\n\nAnswer: _Yes. I found its documenttaion and examples._\n\n#### 2. Does it fulfill all the requirements?\n\nStudy the pattern documentation at the\n<i>Design System / Pattern Library website</i>\nand all the examples provided. This way, you can understand if the pattern is suitable\nfor your specific task.\n\nIf there is no example covering your case, but you suppose that it is still possible\nwithout changing its code, play around with example HTML. For confirmation, ask in the\npeople in communication channels (Slack, Flowdock, etc)\nif the pattern examples can be extended with your case. If they can, it would be nice if you\nmake a pull request illustrating your specific usage.\n\nAnswer: _No. It is close what I need but I need extended functionality._\n\n#### 3. Can it be changed to suit your new requirements while still fitting existing requirements?\n\nFigure out the requirements for the existing component based on the documentation and examples. If you have doubts, ask in the\ninstant communication channels (Slack, Flowdock, etc), at regular meetings\nor in person.\n\nDoes it look that you can provide changes and the component will not be broken in the places it is used now?\n\nAnswer: _Yes. I can provide changes, and nothing will be broken._\n\n#### 4. Implement the pattern\n\n_Wait for release_\n\n## Usage\n\nThis decision helper is meant to be a part of a Design System documentation. Being a React component it can be easily\naltered due to the needs of a specific company or product. Similarly, it can be constantly updated while the processes\nin the Design System are changed and shapen.\n\n#### Source\nThis article was originally published at [varya.me](https://varya.me/design-systems/pattern-journey/).","title":"Pattern Journey","description":"A process of maintaining and extending design systems","layout":"LayoutBlog","seo":{"desc":"Visual illustration and explanation of what happens to a pattern on its way from identifying to actual implementation and how different the path might be depending on the situation.

However, they “frequently putting contradictory demands on people working with the respective processes” (Jones, 2019). Trying to match different disciplines, the designers and developers are supposed to conduct alignment work which brings them to mutual understanding in the context of their work, revealing “design breakdowns” (Maudet, Leiva, Beaudouin-Lafon & Mackay 2017) early enough.<br/>\nThis research aims to find what designers and developers who consider their collaboration process as successful value in each other.\n\n## Research design\n\nTo obtain data of what is designers’ and developers’ perceptions of working with each other, the researcher collected recommendations from LinkedIn profiles. For the final data analysis, there were selected profiles of _7 designers_ and _9 developers_. The recommendations were filtered so that for developers it was only recommendations from designers (and not from people with other roles), and for designers it was only recommendations from developers. The roles of the people were taken as they identify themselves in their LinkedIn Profiles.\n\n![](./recommendation-example.png)\n\n## Codifying\n\nFor the codifying, the data was collected into one document, anonymised and processed with the help of ATLAS.ti. Full text can be found in Appendix 1.\n\nIn the text of recommendations, the researcher outlined _1st level concepts_ — the attributes that colleagues highlighted as valuable. The concepts were unified into _themes_ following the area which they belong to. The list of concepts by themes can be found in Appendix 2.\n\nThe themes were aggregated into _dimensions_ forming the following scheme.\n\n\n![](./codifying.png)\n\n\nThe dimentions are 1) Wideness of expertise, 2) Hard skills, 3) Professional attributes, 4) Soft skills, and 5) Personal attributes.\n\nWideness of expertise includes knowledge of the technical aspects for designers, understanding of design (particularly, UX) value for developers and knowledge in the business domain for both roles. Hard skills assume direct role-related knowledge and being good at collaboration. Professional attributes list the properties which contribute into both hard and soft skills. Soft skills are the factors positively affecting communication. Finally, personal attributes ease communication and break the barriers.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe “wideness of expertise” dimension attracts the most. It is noticeable that designers and developers very much value if their colleagues have some knowledge in their area of expertise. These facts resonate with the findings of factors of successful collaboration between UX designers and UI developers. There, the developers complained about “designers do not know enough about the technical limitations when designing solutions” (Jones, 2019). In particular, the developers mentioned that static designs tend “to lack necessary details about the interaction layer in-browser” (Jones, 2019). Similarly, another research mentions the developers’ complaint regarding collaboration with designers as “designers usually don’t take into account the dynamic nature of the data” (Jones, Volker & Gemma, 2016) Generally, the sharing discipline specific knowledge “allows for in-depth discussions about the technical opportunities and constraints of different ideas” (Jones, 2019) and “collaboration is usually smoother when the designer is aware of the developer’s constraints and possibilities” (Maudet et al. 2017) .Correspondingly, the recommendations’ analysis shows that developers value “prototyping” skills of designers which would bring them dynamic designs including the interaction details.\n\nIn addition, both designers and developers highlighted business and product knowledge as positive.\nThis is probably because both designers and developers would like to make mutual decisions regarding the creating product and seeking the missing expertise in their closest colleagues. The value of same-domain expertise can be explained as first the professionals would like to be sure that they can rely on their colleagues' decisions, and for that they validate the colleagues’ knowledge in the area where they themselves are professionals.\n\nOverall research findings complement the studies which outline that “successful collaboration between designers and developers can be found through the following six factors: 1) Close proximity, 2) Early and frequent communication, 3) Shared ideation and problem solving, 4) Crossing over of knowledge and skills, 5) Co-creation and prototyping and 6) Making joint decisions” (Jones & Thoma, 2019).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe conducted analysis demonstrated correlation with the existing studies. Even though the obtained data was selected randomly and was less than 20 short recommendation texts in total, it allowed to categorize the valuable attributes of designers and developers and showed the match in valuing cross-disciplinary knowledge. The research approach and the method of obtaining data look as a promising contribution into the following study of positive factors for designers’ and developers’ alignment work.\n\n- [Appendix 1.
